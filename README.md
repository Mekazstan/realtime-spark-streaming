### Background Use Case: A driver moving from central London to bemingham. He wants to have an IOT device that collects information about: GPS location, Weather info, road accident info e.t.c. All these devices are being gathered by the IOT device & sent to the system. The goal is to analyse the data in realtime & working on it as well in real time. As the driver is moving from point to point the data is being ollected in real time. If there is a delay on the road we can access them in real time.
